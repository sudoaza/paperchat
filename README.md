> The available open-source tools for aerodynamic simulation are rhoCentralFoam (rCF), su2, and ADflow. The papers discussing these tools are "Verification and Validation of High-Fidelity Open-Source Simulation Tools for Supersonic Aircraft Aerodynamic Analysis" (https://doi.org/10.1115/1.4052150) and "ADflow: An Open-Source Computational Fluid Dynamics Solver for Aerodynamic and Multidisciplinary Optimization" (https://doi.org/10.2514/1.i010796). The paper "Aerodynamic Simulation of a 2017 F1 Car with Open-Source CFD Code" (https://doi.org/10.17265/2328-2142/2018.04.001) also discusses the use of open-source CFD code for aerodynamic simulation of an F1 car.
